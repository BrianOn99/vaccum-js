vaccum.js
=========

A javascript library illustrating a toy model of vacuum fluctuation.
Intended for use in the (now less boring) HK Particle Physics website made by
me.

"vaccum" is a spelling mistake ;-)

There are electron, anti electron and photon, generated randomly and then fly
and disappear.

html canvas is used, so it require a modern browser.
