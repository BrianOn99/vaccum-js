vaccum.js
=========
A javascript library illustrating a toy model of vacuum fluctuation.
Intended for use in the (now less boring) HK Particle Physics website made by
me.

There are electron, anti electron and photon, generated randomly and then fly
and disappear.

html canvas is used, so it require a modern browser.
